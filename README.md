# React Skeleton

_This branch is React only. There's no Router nor Redux in here._

Start your React apps with Webpack and Babel, choosing to use Redux and/or Router
or notâ€”no conventions, everything is vanilla and ready/easy for you to modify
according to your needs.

### Install

`git clone git@github.com:chiefGui/react-skeleton.git`

`npm install`

### Run

`npm run dev`

`open http://localhost:8005/`

### Motivation

Tired to bootstrap my apps with React following others' opinionated standards,
I decided to create this skeleton for those who wants to work with modern
environments with no hassle, following or not a convention and/or middleware
and technology.
